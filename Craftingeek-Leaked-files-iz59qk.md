Since her breakthrough exhibition, Craftingeek has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Craftingeek has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016. Craftingeek began her online journey in 2017, initially creating cosplay and gaming-related content. Her content gradually evolved, becoming increasingly sexually suggestive. She gained initial attention through Twitch streams and Instagram posts featuring provocative imagery and suggestive commentary.
